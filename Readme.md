When a client (typically a web browser) connects to the server, it sends a WebSocket handshake request.
The server responds to this handshake and establishes a WebSocket connection with the client.

The io.on("connection", callback) code sets up a listener for the "connection" event whenever the frontend fires the connection event.
When the WebSocket connection is successfully established, the "connection" event is triggered automatically by Socket.IO.


Question :
So what I underStood is that ,firstly the frontend part send the socket connection request to a specific backend endpoint , then the backend listens that connection through io.on("connection",()=>{}) event and after the connection is listened , the callback function gets executed . Is my understanding correct or is there some corrections ?

Your understanding is mostly correct! Let's break it down step by step:

Frontend Connection Request:

The frontend (client) initiates a WebSocket connection by connecting to a specific backend endpoint. This is often done through Socket.IO's client library on the frontend.
Backend Listens for Connection:

On the backend (server) side, the server is set up to listen for incoming WebSocket connections using the io.on("connection", callback) event.
Connection Event Fired:

When a new connection is established between the frontend and backend, the "connection" event is automatically fired on the server side.
Callback Execution:

The callback function provided to io.on("connection", callback) gets executed. This function is where you can define what actions or events should happen when a new client connects.
Here's a small correction: The backend doesn't exactly "listen" for the connection in the traditional sense, as you might see with HTTP requests where the server actively waits for incoming requests. Instead, Socket.IO handles the low-level details of establishing and managing WebSocket connections.

In summary, your understanding is correct: the frontend initiates the connection, the backend is set up to handle incoming connections, and when a connection is established, the callback function associated with the "connection" event is executed.
